![logo](../images/Logo.png)

## Project Information

**GreeNest** contributes to the **Zero-emission Building (ZeB)** EU future by demonstrating key ways to reduce embodied and operational building emissions.

**GreeNest** develops 16 “Standardized Packages” using recycled, waste, nature-based materials to create adaptable envelop systems, including RES, IoT and Design tools, which are incorporated into the building design, together with human response to demonstrate resource-efficient zero emission construction.

**GreeNest** main objective is to create, validate and widely promote a nested solution based on a digitized platform to deliver a unified **ecosystem comprising abiotic and biotic solutions** to allow the fast and wide uptake of Zero emission Buildings
